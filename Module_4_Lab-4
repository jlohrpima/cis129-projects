# Calculates store and employee bonuses based off sales amount and % sales increase

#A retail company assigns a $6,000 store bonus if monthly sales are more than 
#$110,000; else if monthly sales are greater than or equal to $100,000 the store 
#bonus is $5,000, else if monthly sales are greater than or equal to $90,000 the 
#store bonus is $4,000, else if monthly sales are greater than or equal to $80,000,
# the store bonus is $3,000 otherwise a $0 amount or no store bonus is awarded.  
# They are using a percent of sales increase to determine if employees get 
# individual bonuses.  If sales increased by an amount greater than or equal to 5%
# (0.05) then all employees get $75, else if sales increased by an amount greater 
# than or equal to 4%, employees get $50, else if sales increased by an amount 
# greater than or equal to 3% employees get $40 otherwise they get $0.
